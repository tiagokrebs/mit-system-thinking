mens et manus (mind and hand) approach

Reflection is a process that allows you to analyze your own experience, make changes based on the lessons that you've learned, keep doing what is successful, and integrate new knowledge and techniques into your repertoire. By thinking carefully about what you are doing and why you are doing it, you can turn your experiences into meaningful learning. The more you become a reflective practitioner, the more you can continue to learn from your own experience.
