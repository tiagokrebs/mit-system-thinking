# Foundation of systems thinking

- Structure: what we observe about a system, what is
- Function: based on the structure we can see what it does
- Emergence function: what is does give us the value of the system

## System Thinking
Come examples of systems:
- Natural environment
- Education
- Health care
- National Security

Systems thinking is simple thinking of things as systems.
Systems are things that have entities and relationships, elements and connections.

Our limited cognitive ability make systems look too complex. How systems thinking make it simple?

A system is a set of `interrelated entities` that `perform a function` whose functionality is `greater that the sum of its parts`.  
- Entities: modules, elements or chunks that are distinct an otherwise independent.  
- Relationship: to be a system these parts have to be interrelated.  
- Function: the interrelated parts perform a function.
- Emergence: this behavior is grater that can be delivered by the sum of the parts.

Systems thinking helps make complex things appear simple.

Example: coffee machine
- Composed by the water reservoir, the heat system and the coffee pot.
- The emergence is that we put water and coffee grain on one side and take a well-done coffee on another.

Why become a system thinker?
- We live amongst complex systems
- We need to make complex things feel simple
- We need to be problem solvers
- we need to understand emergence


## Emergence

The function of the systems there is **more powerful than the sum of the parts** is called Emergence.

Example:
An hourglass have funnel and sand as the entities. Put his together and a new function emerges, keeping time. Both entities have nothing to do with time until they are putting together in a system.

`Function` is the most powerful type of emergence.
- Run some machine learning code -> Image recognition
- Get on an elevetor -> Transportation

`Performance` is an emergent property of a system. Is also a powerful form of emergence.
- Transporting people -> The elevator move people under 30s
- Image recognition -> Recognize images of X pixels in 1s

There is also `non-functions attributes` we call emergences. We called `"ilities"`
- Reliability -> The measure of performance consistency
    - Breakdowns are loss of the attribute of reliability.
- Serviceability -> The measure if ease of repair
    - If you have to fix a breakdown serviceability is involved.  

Ilities occur in almost any system.
- Elevator -> Safety
- Image recognition -> Reliability

Another type of emergence is `emergency`. That is emergence that is destructive or undesirable.
- Plagues and droughts
- Explosions and, crashes


All types of systems have emergencies. We can have in:
- Mechanical systems
- Organizational systems
- Informational systems
- Natural systems

Emergence of function - the system does something that was never done before   
Emergence of performance – the system does something better than before  
Emergence is of the ilities or non-functional attributes – the system has more reliability  
Emergence of an emergency that we don’t want to happen  


## Function

`Function` are the activities, operations and transformations that cause or contribute to performance.
- Provides the actions
- What happens when a system operates
- Emergence occurs in the functional domain
    - When interrelated entities perform a `function` whose functionality is greater than the sum of the parts
    - The magic is in the function

Examples
- The function of circulatory system on the human body -> deliver oxygen to cell in the body
- The function of a work of art -> intrigue the viewer
- The function of a debit card -> to post a debt eletronically

A function describes a change created by the system. A function contain two parts:
- The change itself or the Process.
    - A pattern of transformation of the operand. The process creates, changes or destroys the operand.
    - You cannot touch a process, it's fleeting, it takes places along the time.
    - Where the change happens.
- The thing it is being changed or operated, the Operand.
    - A thing that exists, and whose states or attributes can be changed by a process.
    - Can be physical, like the art viewer.
    - Can be informational, a record of debit.
    - What has changed.

In a development team developing a new feature, `Develop` is the function and the `feature` is the operand.

The system function is related to the benefit delivered by the system.

All systems have a primary function, the necessary thing a system does, the primary function is usually clear from the designer's intent of from observation. There is of course the possibility that a system to have secondary functions.

Function describes the change created by the system.  The description of a function contains two parts: the change itself, which is what we call the process; and the thing that is changed or operated on, which we called the operand.

- Function is what a system does
- It is how systems create benefit 
- It consists of an operand that is changed, and a process that brings about the change 
- Emergence occurs in the functional domain


## Form

`Form` is what the system is. It's the physical or informational embodiment of the system,
- Material
- Configuration
- Text
- Instructions

What is implemented?
- Written
- Composed
- Manufactured
- Created

If it is some of the above it is probably Form.

Physical form can be:
- Mechanisms
- Molecules
- Facilities
- Circuits
- Building blocks
- Infrastructure

Informational Form can be:
- Poetry
- Literature
- Code
- Instructions

`Form` is the instrument of `function` and must be present for the function to be delivered.
- The function of a work of art -> intrigue the viewer -> The form is the piece of art
- The function of a debit card -> to post a debt eletronically -> The form is the car

`Form` is what the system is
- Can be captured in an image
- It's the instrument of function

`Function` is what the systems do
- It need to be captured in a movie


```
|--------------|
|     Form     |
| |----------| |
| | Process  | |
| | Operand  | |
| |----------| |
|--------------|
```

Form and Function are separate and complementary aspects of a system. But why Form is important if Emergence occur in the Function domain? The Form needs to be there in order to enable the function.

A robot that moves a payload has a function "to move" and an operand "payload" but the cost of this operation related to the robot, which is associated with the parts and the manufacture of it.

The benefit of a system is associated with the function, while the cost is largely identified with the form.

Value is benefit at cost.
```
      Value        -> Benefit  <-> Function
(Benefit at cost)  -> Cost     <-> Form
```

The benefit provided by team X
```
Quality product     -> Successful product  <-> Develop product
under budget        -> Salaries            <-> Team of people
```

- Form is the physical or informational embodiment of the system – what it IS
- Form is the instrument of function – what the system does
- Value is benefit at cost, benefit derives from function, cost is dependent on form
- Abstractions help make systems appear simple by hiding un-needed details
