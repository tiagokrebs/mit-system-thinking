## System Dynamics
- “[Business Dynamics](http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/BusDyn2.html)” by John D. Sterman
- Fighting the Physics of Human Nature: Acceleration Mental Model Effects on Project Schedule and Cost Performance by Paul Newton [course Industry Expert] https://proceedings.systemdynamics.org/2019/proceed/papers/P2017.pdf  this paper studies how certain mindsets lead us to accelerate projects provoking a paradoxical effect, projects get more delayed:
- “We always produce worst-case schedules, so there is always slack in the schedule.”
- “Tasks take up the time allocated to them.”
- “People are lazy; they will goof off if not pushed."
- “I know we didn’t finish on time on the last project, but we’ll do it right this time.”
- “We just have to work harder.”
- “Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update”
