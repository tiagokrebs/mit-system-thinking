# Graded Peer-Reviewed Activity – Foundation of System Thinking

You have been prompted to answer questions on your professional and personal activity systems throughout the course. This final assignment will focus on collecting the information on your professional activity system that you’ve already answered, identify, and fill in any missing elements. Feel free to change your previously submitted answers as necessary.

Your remaining task is to apply your newfound system thinking knowledge to your professional activity system.

Think about an audience you would be presenting this system to (e.g., your company’s leadership) and the circumstances of the presentation (e.g., for a new product line or policy initiative).

* Accessibility note: If you have any issues to access or create visual information, please contact us to xPROSysThinkTA@gmail.com and we will provide you with further instructions on how to complete this assignment.

Step 1: Download this TEMPLATE and read the "Sample answer" (slides 2 to 5.)

Step 2: On the same template file as above, complete the information from your own professional activity system (slides 6 to 9). You may reuse material from the first two weeks and alter it as necessary to complete this activity. In this assignment, you will:

- Provide an overview of your system (describe the scenario, expected emergent function, and problems associated with the emergent function.)
- Create a visual representation of the important entities in the system and context. Learn how to make a visual representation of your system with Professor Ed Crawley's Tutorial for Representing Systems (you can download the file or read the file embedded below).
- Complete a table naming the pairs of components, and describe the structure and interaction.
- Describe problem entities and their relationships, and system solution. 
Step 3: Submit your .pptx, .ppt, or .pdf file in the next page.

Step 4: Please note: the system will assign you the work of three of your peers to review after your assignment submission. Review their submissions by following this evaluation RUBRIC. You need to perform the peer review within the first 24 hours after you start reviewing one of the submissions, otherwise, the system will assign you three new random assignments for your review. Your assignment does not show as complete until you finish these four steps.

DISCLAIMER: Do not include any information that would violate security, confidentiality, or intellectual property regulation.

## Activity Checklist
Use the following summary as a checklist for your final assignment (you do not need to touch every point, neither have to use this sequence):

- What is your system’s form and function? Reminder: Form is what the system is, and the function is what it does.  
- What are the entities of your system? Which entities have a form that enables their function?  
- What are the relationships within your system? What are the structures that enable the interactions?  
- How do the functions of your system entities interact to produce emergence and value?  
- Identify and describe your system’s emergence.  
- Does thinking about your system holistically, as widely as practical, help you prepare to focus on the essential features?  
- How would creating abstractions about your system reveal necessary information and conceal complexity?  
- Thinking about the whole and parts, is it easier to apply composition or decomposition when describing your system?  
- Similar to the previous question, can you create the hierarchy of a system and the reasoning for top-down and/or bottom-up?  
- Define your system boundaries and interfaces, separating the system from the context  
- Which method would be the most applicable to predict emergence for your system (i.e., human reasoning supported by precedent, and/or modeling and experiments)?  

Read the following tutorial created by Professor Ed Crawley where you will learn how to represent a system in the context of this course. You will need to review this guide for completing this assignment, as you need to create a visual representation of your professional system.
