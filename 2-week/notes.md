# Emergence and System Success

The last task on system thinking is to predict and understand emergence.
- Is the more important and most difficult aspect of system thinking
- Is closely related to the value produced
- Reasoning from the Form need to understand the function to understand emergence
- Is possible to reasoning emergence directly from the form

Example: Supply chain.
The emergence is the transformation of raw materials to goods in the hands of the consumer.

## Predicting emergence

Possible results for emergence:
- The expected function emerge. Eg: a team develops a product on time to spec.
- The expected function fails to emerge of the performance is degraded. Eg: the team develop a good product but 30% over schedule
- An unexpected function emerges. Eg: the team quit because it's being pushed too hard.
    - Usually this is bad.
    - Emergency: when destructive or undesirable emergence occurs.
    - Sometimes unexpected emergence can be good. Eg: the discovery of penicillin

Sometimes there is a kind of emergence that occurs when you treat a part of an existing system and the change propagates or ripples through the system.
- You modify an entity, then interactions and structure that touch the modified entity probably change.
- The overall function and performance might change

- Emergence occurs when the functions of entities interact through the functional relationships 
- Emergence is enabled by the form of entities (the instrument of the function) and the form of the relationships (the instrument of interaction). 
- When emergence actually is tested, the possible results are that the expected emergence occurs, it fails to emerge, or an unexpected emergence occurs 
- When a piece of a system is altered, that change can propagate far throughout the system. 

## Understanding emergence

Predicting emergence is the hardest thing to do in system thinking, and it's the most important. The greatest tool we have to predict emergence is our own cognitive reasoning. System thinking is fundamentally a way to think. It's not about a team building a model. It's about reasoning by an individual.

Types of understanding:
- Precedent
    - You know from your past
- Experimentation
    - Build the real thing and test it
- Modeling
    - Construct an analytical or numerical model
- Human reasoning
    - When none of these methods are available you can only use your cognitive reasoning and your skills in systems thinking. 

The way in which the entities of the system are connected, the structure, plays a significant role in emergence. So we have to be able to reason from the structure to the interactions and then to the functions of the entities. In this way, we can understand the emergent function of the system.

- It’s hard, but since emergence is why we deal with systems, It’s essential 
- Emergence can be understood and predicted by human reasoning, supported by precedent, experimentation and modeling. 
- For unprecedented systems, where modeling and experimentation are not easy, only human reasoning is available to predict emergence 
- This is the real goal, and the real art in System Thinking
