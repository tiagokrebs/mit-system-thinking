# Emergence and System Sccess

The last task on system thinking is to predict and understand emergence.
- Is the more important and most difficult aspect of system thinking
- Is closely related to the value produced
- Reasoning from the Form need to understand the function to understand emergence
- Is possible to reasoning emergence directly from the form

Example: Supply chain.
The emergence is the transformation of raw materials to goods in the hands of the consumer.

Possible results for emergence:
- The expected function emerge. Eg: a team develops a product on time to spec.
- The expected function fails to emerge of the performance is degraded. Eg: the team develop a good product but 30% over schedule
- An unexpected function emerges. Eg: the team quit because it's being pushed too hard.
    - Usually this is bad.
    - Emergency: when destructive or undesirable emergence occurs.
    - Sometimes unexpected emergence can be good. Eg: the discovery of penicillin

Sometimes there is a kind of emergence that occurs when you treat a part of an existing system and the change propagates or ripples through the system.
- You modify an entity, then interactions and structure that touch the modified entity probably change.
- The overall function and performance might change

- Emergence occurs when the functions of entities interact through the functional relationships 
- Emergence is enabled by the form of entities (the instrument of the function) and the form of the relationships (the instrument of interaction). 
- When emergence actually is tested, the possible results are that the expected emergence occurs, it fails to emerge, or an unexpected emergence occurs 
- When a piece of a system is altered, that change can propagate far throughout the system.
