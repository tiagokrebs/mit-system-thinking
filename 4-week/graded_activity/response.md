Recommendations
- We should ensure high quality from the beginning and not allow anyone down a notch on this at almost any cost. Adding a QA Team on the loop will ensure we create a testing culture and the discovery of rework during the project, not after. The amount of rework is directly connected with the schedule and quality of the project. More rework discovered during the project should give us a better end product and so be more competitive at the market. And so, we should never cut testing and bring quality insurance methods for the hole process.

- Although is quite normal they appear during our projects we should avoid changes after the design phase or at least the majority of them. Ensuring high quality from the beginning the design team will have the resources to deliver a well researched and designed. That is to say, late modifications should be more related with some external benchmarking and focused on increasing market share and not because a fail on the process. In our company, we need to give more focus on the UX/UI teams, and make them work with the retail and marketing team from the beginning.

- Start with at least 70% more people than planned. We have learned this from the past projects. Good people in the technology market are hard to find and rookies sometimes can have a steep learning curve. We should hire and train people from the start. That way we will ensure we had the correct amount of experience people when is needed and in the long run will ensure the amount of errors made and rework take.

- We should overtime as a last resource. It is also common to have peaks of management pressure on the teams during the project we can deny that, but in some occasions we fail in attribute some problems that happened to the effect of fatigue of the people. We know this is a recurrent loop, we increase the hours, productivity rises for some weeks and suddenly drops. The fatigue of the staff lower the quality and start a process of drop off sometimes. We should be more careful here and slow down before these signs.

- Last but not least, we should not cut corners for the sake of the schedule or external pressure. Cut phases we consider less important like training the staff or document the use of the product certainly will lead to problems we will to deal later. For instance, the amount of support calls we'll have if the product is too complex. We should think in some of these steps like the ensured of quality too and doing this we again won't have that amount of undesired rework on the future. Likewise, we should have a better description of the steps of our process, why they are important and past results we had when we give the proper focus or not to them.
