## Step 1: Write a memo for senior leadership
Write an ~800 word memo for the senior leadership of your organization presenting your recommendations to improve the way your organization manages projects. Focus on the type of projects that are typical in your actual organization. If you are not currently involved in project management, note that projects can span any domain, including construction, hardware, software, or any other context—they can be large or small, in for-profit firms or governments or nonprofits, military or civilian, or any other setting where teams of people must work together to generate deliverables that meet certain requirements, budget, and deadline.

1. Describe briefly what is the mission of your organization, the services you offer, and your clients (if applicable) to provide context for your peers to aid them in evaluating your proposals.
1. Consider the following guidelines when writing your memo:
    - Describe at least 5 actionable recommendations that could be implemented in your organization.
    - Present policies that are applicable to a variety of real-world projects, not decisions specific to a particular project, e.g.: “Set the workweek to 60 hours throughout the project to increase progress while avoiding excessive worker fatigue” is a decision; “Require your team to work long hours until you are sure they are suffering from fatigue” is a policy (though not necessarily a good one—the choice of policies is up to you). If you chose this policy, explain how, in real life, project managers could determine what workweek would avoid excessive worker fatigue, and how you would determine whether and how burned out they are.
-   Explain each recommendation, including how and why you expect it would help improve project performance.
    - Avoid technical jargon. Draw on your experience with the project simulator, but make sure your recommendations are applicable to the real world and presented in plain language suitable for the managers and leaders of your organization.
    - Ensure your recommendations are robust to realistic uncertainties you and your organization face. Every project is different and faces different technological, market, human resource, cost, time pressures, and other conditions.
    - Be realistic but not cynical. Your recommendations should be implementable in your organization, but don’t assume that change is impossible. Make a case for the value and benefits of your proposals. Consider how you might address resistance to change and increase the likelihood of successful implementation.
    - Download these files:
        - Submission template: Instructions and template to prepare your response.
        - Evaluation rubric: Make sure you accomplish the required criteria

## Step 2: Submit your assignment
Go to the next page and copy and paste the text you prepared in a word processor software or in the template above for each of the five recommendations in each of the five prompts. We would highly encourage you not to write your recommendations directly on the next page to prevent the loss of information.

## Step 3: Review the work of three peers
- Once you submit your assignment, the system will automatically assign you the work of three peers to evaluate their assignments. The system will show you the evaluation rubric, but we recommend you download and review the rubric before you complete your assignment too to make sure you meet the required criteria.
- Make sure you review the assignments from your peers within the first 24 hours after you complete the first review, otherwise the system might reassign you three new assignments. 

## Step 4: Review your grade
Once you submit the assignment, review the work of three peers, and get the evaluation from two of your peers on your assignment, you will be able to check your grade for this activity in the Progress bar.
